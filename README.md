Here’s a clean `README.md` draft for your Train Ticket Booking System project:

---

# 🚆 Train Ticket Booking System (Java CLI)

A **Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Train Ticket Booking System** built in Java.
It uses a **local JSON database** for persistence, managed through **Jackson ObjectMapper**.

This project simulates a real-world train booking flow with essential features such as **user authentication**, **train search**, and **ticket booking**.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔑 **User Authentication**

  * Signup with new credentials
  * Login with existing account
  * Logout safely

* 🚉 **Train Management**

  * Search available trains by ID, source, destination, or other criteria
  * View train details

* 🎟 **Ticket Booking**

  * Book train tickets for logged-in users
  * Validate seat availability

* 🗂 **Local JSON Database**

  * Stores user details, trains, and bookings persistently
  * Managed using **Jackson ObjectMapper**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Java 17+**
* **Jackson Databind** (for JSON parsing & mapping)
* **Local JSON files** (acting as database)

Would you like me to also add **example JSON structures** for `users.json`, `trains.json`, and `tickets.json` in the README so contributors understand the DB schema immediately?
